Lisbon keeps surprising people. You expect a pretty city, and it delivers — but what nobody tells you before you go is how *alive* the place feels. Trams rattling up hills that should really have escalators, the smell of grilled sardines drifting through the Alfama at dusk, a glass of Vinho Verde that costs less than a Diet Coke back home.

We did 5 days in early February — off-season, cheaper flights, almost no queues. Here's exactly what we did, what we'd change, and how to plan your own version.

## Day 1 — Alfama & the waterfront

Fly in, drop your bags and head straight to the Alfama before you lose the afternoon light. This is Lisbon's oldest neighbourhood — a tangle of steep alleyways, tiled buildings and cats sleeping on every available surface.

Walk up to the **Miradouro da Graça** for the panoramic view over the city and the Tagus. Stay for sunset. Then wind down through the streets to **Time Out Market** on the waterfront for dinner — yes, it's a bit touristy, but the food quality is genuinely excellent and it's a good first-night introduction to what Portuguese cuisine actually is.

> 💡 **Tip:** Book the tuk-tuk tour of Alfama in advance if you want one — they sell out by mid-morning in peak season.

## Day 2 — Belém

Take tram 15E west along the river to Belém. This is where the explorers set off from in the 15th century, and the monuments have the grandiosity you'd expect from a country that once ruled the seas. The **Torre de Belém** and **Jerónimos Monastery** are both worth your time — book monastery tickets online the night before to skip the queue.

Most importantly: eat a pastel de nata at **Pastéis de Belém**, the original bakery that's been making them since 1837. The queue looks intimidating but moves fast. Get two. Maybe three.

## Day 3 — Sintra day trip

Sintra is 40 minutes by train from Rossio station and is one of those places that feels genuinely unreal. Palaces perched on clifftops, forests full of moss and mystery, the Atlantic visible in the distance.

The **Pena Palace** is the headline act — luridly coloured, romantically absurd, absolutely worth it. Buy your timed entry ticket the week before. Combine with a walk up to the **Moorish Castle** for views back over the palace. Back in the village, try the local speciality: travesseiros from Piriquita bakery.

> 💡 **Tip:** Get the first train out (around 7am) if you want Pena Palace without crowds. It genuinely makes a difference.

## Day 4 — LX Factory & Príncipe Real

**LX Factory** is a repurposed industrial complex in the Alcântara neighbourhood — independent shops, good coffee, street art and a general sense that this is where Lisbon's creative class actually hangs out. On Sundays there's a market. Worth a full morning.

Head up to **Príncipe Real** in the afternoon — a quieter, more residential neighbourhood with excellent independent restaurants and a Saturday antiques market. Dinner here rather than anywhere more tourist-facing is the move.

## Day 5 — Baixa & go slow

Save your last day for wandering without a plan. The **Baixa** grid of streets around Praça do Comércio is good for this — flat (a rarity in Lisbon), full of independent shops and an easy walk to most things. Pick up tinned fish as a gift — it's genuinely excellent and the tins are beautiful objects.

Late lunch, airport, home. You'll already be thinking about when to go back.

## Practical bits

**Getting around:** Lisbon's hills are steep enough that you'll want to use the trams and funiculars rather than walking everything. The 24-hour transport card is good value. Uber also works well and is cheap.

**Where to stay:** Chiado or Príncipe Real for atmosphere and central location. Avoid Bairro Alto if you want to sleep before 2am — it's loud.

**Budget:** Lisbon is still cheaper than most western European capitals but prices have risen noticeably. Budget £80–100 per person per day including accommodation, food and activities. You can do it for less with picnic lunches and slower days.
